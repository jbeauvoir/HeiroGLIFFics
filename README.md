Automating AWS With Python and Boto3

A special thanks to Michael J who presented an awesome tutorial on how to make these scripts. If you would like to check out his tutorial visit https://linuxacademy.com/howtoguides/posts/show/topic/14209-automating-aws-with-python-and-boto3.

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):
IAM enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. For more documentation go to https://aws.amazon.com/iam/.

I have given the IAM user AmazonRDSFullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess, and AmazonEC2FullAccess.

These scripts allow you to:
- Create, delete, list, and put files into a bucket 
- Create, terminate, and list running instances
- Create, delete, and list database instances (only the instance)
